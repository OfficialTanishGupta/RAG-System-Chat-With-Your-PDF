📄 RAG System — Chat With Your PDF

An AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to upload a PDF document and interact with it through natural language queries.

The system retrieves relevant content from the PDF and generates intelligent responses based only on the document's information.

This project demonstrates document understanding, semantic search, embeddings, vector databases, and LLM-based question answering.

🚀 Features

✅ Upload and process PDF documents
✅ Extract and chunk text from PDFs
✅ Convert text into vector embeddings
✅ Store embeddings in a vector database
✅ Perform semantic similarity search
✅ Generate answers using retrieved context
✅ Chat-style interface for asking questions
✅ Ability to visualize data (graphs if numeric data exists)

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-chat-with-pdf.git

cd rag-chat-with-pdf

Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ Usage

Run the application

python app.py

Example Query:

Question: What are the key topics discussed in the document?
Answer: The document mainly discusses machine learning models,
data preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics.
🔍 How It Works

1️⃣ Extract text from the PDF
2️⃣ Split the text into small chunks
3️⃣ Convert chunks into vector embeddings
4️⃣ Store vectors in FAISS vector database
5️⃣ Convert user query into embedding
6️⃣ Perform similarity search
7️⃣ Retrieve relevant chunks
8️⃣ Generate answer using the retrieved context

📊 Example Use Cases

• Research paper assistant
• Study material Q&A
• Legal document analysis
• Company policy chatbot
• Financial report analysis

🔮 Future Improvements

Multi-PDF support

Memory-based conversations

Advanced document summarization

Hybrid search (BM25 + Vector Search)

Faster embedding models

Web UI with file upload

📸 Demo
User: What is the conclusion of the document?

AI: The conclusion highlights that machine learning models
perform better when trained on properly cleaned datasets
and evaluated with cross-validation techniques.
